# PyQR
A simple QR Code generator and decoder written in Python 3.

The source code might be a little bit messy, I'll try to refactor and reorganize it someday.

You can read my articles about QR Code: https://yeecy.medium.com/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E8%A3%BD%E4%BD%9C-qr-code-0-%E5%89%8D%E8%A8%80-e464466dc321
